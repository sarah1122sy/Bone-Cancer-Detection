# Bone Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project applies a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify bone X-ray images into **Cancer** or **Normal**.  
The trained model is deployed using a **Flask web interface** to allow users to upload images and get real-time predictions.

## 🧠 Project Idea
Bone cancer diagnosis through medical imaging is often complex and time-consuming.  
This project builds a **deep learning model** that can automatically detect bone cancer from X-ray images and provide a confidence score for the prediction.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Flask** – for the interactive web interface  
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**
- **Pillow (PIL)**, **Scikit-learn**
- **HTML / CSS** – for web UI design

## 📊 Project Stages
1. **Data Collection** – bone X-ray images categorized as *Cancer* or *Normal*.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – using `ImageDataGenerator` and `Data Augmentation`.  
3. **Model Building** – CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers.  
4. **Training the Model** – fine-tuned with the Adam optimizer.  
5. **Evaluation** – accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.  
6. **Web Deployment** – Flask interface for uploading and testing images.

## 🧪 Model Results
- ✅ **Test Accuracy:** ~91%  
- 📈 **AUC (ROC Curve):** 0.97  
The model achieved an accuracy of 91% and an AUC of 0.97, which indicates that while a few predictions might be slightly off around the decision threshold, the model overall has a very strong ability to distinguish between cancerous and normal images.

## 🖼️ Flask Web Interface
The Flask web app allows users to upload an X-ray image, analyze it, and instantly display the prediction along with the confidence level.
